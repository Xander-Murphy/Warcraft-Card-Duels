## 4. Target Market: TAM, SAM, and SOM

The target market for Warcraft Card Duels is the PC gaming market, with a more specific focus on players who enjoy role-playing games (RPGs), strategy, character customization, and turn-based combat. Market data shows that PC gaming represents a large and established portion of the overall video game industry. According to Newzoo, the global games market generated $201.6 billion in revenue during 2025, with PC gaming accounting for $43.6 billion. Newzoo's 2025 market data also estimated approximately 936 million PC players worldwide.

### Total Addressable Market (TAM)

The Total Addressable Market represents the broadest market that the game could potentially reach if there were no limitations based on genre, audience, or distribution. For Warcraft Card Duels, the TAM is the global PC gaming market.

**TAM: approximately $43.6 billion in annual revenue and approximately 936 million PC players.**

This provides a broad measure of the potential audience for a PC game. However, Warcraft Card Duels is not intended to compete for the attention of every PC gamer. The game is specifically designed around RPG, strategy, team-building, and turn-based combat mechanics, making the RPG market a more appropriate measure of the serviceable market.

**Source:** Newzoo, *Global Games Market 2025*.

### Serviceable Available Market (SAM)

The Serviceable Available Market represents the portion of the TAM that more closely matches the type of game being developed. For Warcraft Card Duels, this is the PC RPG market.

A 2025 market-research estimate from PW Consulting places the global RPG market at approximately $94.2 billion. Its platform breakdown estimates that PC RPG games generated approximately **$20.64 billion**, representing about 21.9% of the global RPG market.

**SAM: approximately $20.64 billion in annual PC RPG revenue.**

This estimate is more relevant to Warcraft Card Duels than the overall PC gaming market because the project is specifically designed as a PC RPG with team-building, character abilities, dungeon progression, and turn-based combat. The same market-research source estimates the global turn-based RPG segment at approximately **$14.01 billion** in 2025. Because this figure includes multiple platforms, it is used as supporting genre context rather than as the project's PC-only SAM.

The SAM should therefore be viewed as an estimate of the broader commercial market available to PC RPG games rather than a prediction of how much revenue Warcraft Card Duels could generate.

**Source:** PW Consulting, *Worldwide RPG Games Market 2026*, using its 2025 market estimates.

### Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)

The Serviceable Obtainable Market represents the portion of the SAM that a small student-developed game could realistically attempt to reach. Unlike TAM and SAM, it would be misleading to claim that Warcraft Card Duels will capture a precise percentage of the multi-billion-dollar RPG market. The project's limited development resources, small team size, lack of an established commercial brand, and limited marketing budget make even a very small market share difficult to predict.

Instead, SOM can be represented using potential unit-sales scenarios. For example, if the finished game were sold for approximately $5:

| Copies Sold | Example Revenue |
| ----------: | --------------: |
|           5 |             $25 |
|          10 |             $50 |
|          30 |            $150 |

These figures are planning scenarios rather than forecasts. They demonstrate the scale of audience required for a small independent game to generate revenue without assuming that it will capture an arbitrary percentage of the overall RPG market.

The most realistic initial SOM for Warcraft Card Duels is therefore a relatively small portion of the PC RPG audience, with success measured by attracting a dedicated group of players, receiving positive feedback, and demonstrating that the game's core team-building and turn-based combat systems can retain players. If the game were eventually expanded and commercially distributed, its obtainable market could grow through additional heroes, dungeons, abilities, and content.

# 8. Mom Test Analysis

## Findings

### Common Problems

* Repetitive/unengaging combat that is predictable
* decisions do not matter
* lacking meaningful progression
* lack of strategic depth

### Current Alternatives

* World of Warcraft
* Baldur's Gate 3
* Clair Obscur: Expedition 33
* Pokemon

### Desired Features

* Meaningful progression with clear goals
* Strategic combat that requires planning and forethought
* Team synergy
* Unique characters distinct playstyles/builds
* Varied encounters
* Engaging boss battles
* Rewards/achievements
* Story or other goals than just playing the game

### Behavioral Evidence

An overwhelming majority of respondants express their commitment to the genre many stating several hours every day with others stating multipe times throughout the week

Some participants reported quitting or taking long breaks from games because content was boring or no longer meaningful to them. Others report that the lack of progression or speed of progression pushes them away.

### Product Implications

Use the findings to determine whether changes should be made to:

* Hero variety
  * Should maintain a diverse roster of heroes, original 30 may be too much, having so many may be hard to make each one feel unique

* Team size
  * Original team size of 3 should stay, players want unique team composition without being hindered by too many options or complexity

* Ability design
  * abilities should have synergy and couterplay, not just reskins of the same thing on each hero, need to be unique

* Combat complexity
  * should have enough depth to require planning without being extremely complicated, responses valued decision making with some expressing a desire for short and simple

* Encounter variety
  * One of the most important things from response pool, players commonly get bored with static encounters and repetitive combat, current random enemies is a start but enemies need unique behavior

* Progression
  * Needs significant attention, players consistently wanted a clear sense of advancement. meaningful rewards, achievements, collections, or increasingly powerful abilities

# 9. Feasibility Plan

## Current Prototype

The project is already in active development using **Python and Pygame**.

The current architecture uses:

```text
Game
│
├── GameState
│
├── MainMenuScreen
├── TeamSelectionScreen
├── DungeonSelectionScreen
└── DungeonScreen
```

This modular structure separates game management from individual screens and allows additional functionality to be added without rewriting the entire application.

---

## Implementation Strategy

Development will continue incrementally.

### Phase 1 — Foundation

Completed:

* Python/Pygame project setup
* Game loop
* Game states
* Main menu
* Screen architecture
* Hero classes
* Enemy classes
* Hero statistics
* Ability system foundation
* Team selection
* Dungeon selection
* Dungeon structure
* Unit testing
* Generate 1–3 enemies per encounter

### Phase 2 — Combat

Next:

* Determine turn order
* Select hero actions
* Display available abilities
* Select targets
* Execute abilities
* Apply damage and effects
* Track health
* Process enemy actions
* Detect victory and defeat

### Phase 3 — Encounters & Progression

After combat:

* Add different enemy behaviors
* Implement dungeon progression
* Add increasing difficulty
* Add boss encounters
* Connect encounters into a complete gameplay loop

### Phase 4 — Content & Polish

Final development will focus on:

* Expand the hero roster while maintaining meaningful differences between heroes.
* Adding additional abilities
* Balancing heroes and enemies
* Improving UI
* Adding assets
* Testing
* Fixing bugs
* Improving usability

> The project will prioritize a complete and playable core gameplay loop over the size of the final content library. If development time becomes limited, additional heroes, abilities, dungeons, and visual assets can be reduced or postponed without preventing the core game from being completed.

---

# 10. Technical Feasibility

The project is feasible because the required technologies are already familiar and the core architecture has been implemented.

### Programming

**Python** provides the primary programming language and supports the project's object-oriented architecture.

### Game Framework

**Pygame** provides:

* Window management
* Rendering
* Keyboard input
* Game loop functionality
* Basic graphical interfaces
* Provides core game engine without needing something more complex

### Development Environment

The project uses **uv** for Python environment and dependency management.

### Testing

The project uses Python's testing framework to test individual game components such as heroes and enemies.

### Architecture

The modular architecture reduces the risk of changes in one system breaking unrelated parts of the game.

| Hero/team system        | High                  |
| Turn-based combat       | High                  |
| Random encounters       | High                  |
| Enemy behaviors         | High                  |
| Boss encounters         | High                  |
| Core gameplay loop      | High                  |
| 15-30 heroes            | Moderate              |
| High-end graphics       | Low                   |
| Large-scale multiplayer | Outside current scope |

The project is feasible because its scope is intentionally focused on a small single-player RPG rather than attempting to reproduce the scale of a commercial RPG game. Alongside the technology and base foundation already being implemented and expandable

---

# 12. Conclusion

Warcraft Card Duels addresses a desire for a focused strategic RPG experience by combining team building, unique characters, turn-based combat, and dungeon progression.

The project has already progressed beyond the conceptual stage and has an implemented foundation consisting of game states, screens, heroes, enemies, abilities, team selection, and dungeon selection.

The primary remaining development challenge is completing the combat and encounter loop, followed by expanding content and testing the game with potential users.

The strongest opportunity for the project is its focused scope:

> **Build a simple, strategic, replayable RPG where the player's team composition and ability choices determine how they overcome each encounter.**
